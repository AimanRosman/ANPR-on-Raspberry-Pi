# ANPR-on-Raspberry-Pi
 Automatic Number Plate Recognition using Computer Vision

I created an ANPR camera system using OpenCV and Pytesseract
I am utilizing OpenCV to detect number plate patterns by configuring it to identify black rectangular shapes containing alphanumeric characters, confirming them as number plates. Subsequently, I employ Pytesseract to read and extract the relevant data from the detected plates.
